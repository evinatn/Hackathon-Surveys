 <h1 align="center"> GitHub Guide </h1> 

GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.
This tutorial teaches you GitHub essentials like repositories, branches, commits, and pull requests. 

In this quickstart guide, you will:

- Create and use a repository
- Start and manage a new branch
- Make changes to a file and push them to GitHub as commits
- Open and merge a pull request

To complete this tutorial, you need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/) and Internet access.

## Creating a repository

A repository is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets -- anything your project needs.
<mark> *You will have to make a repository to upload all your project files for the final submission/ review.* </mark>

Often, repositories include a README file, a file with information about your project. README files are written in the plain text Markdown language. You can use this [cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) to get started with Markdown syntax.

1. In the upper-right corner of any page, use the + drop-down menu, and select New repository.
